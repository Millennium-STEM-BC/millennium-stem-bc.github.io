                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Hi, thank you so much for coming.
                                    I’m Anders Lee, and I’m the co-finance and sponsorship director on the Millennium
                                    STEM executive team, and this is Sophie, the co-chair of Millennium STEM BC. I’d
                                    just like to ask you a few questions about yourself and STEM. To start off, could
                                    you please tell me a little bit about yourself?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Well, it’s nice to
                                    meet you both. My name is Maaike, I’m one of four daughters—so I grew up in an
                                    all-girls home in British Columbia for the most part. We did move around a lot,
                                    growing up, but yeah—basically Vancouver, Richmond, and also on Vancouver Island.
                                    Growing up, my dad was a [professor] in Economics so I was very familiar with being
                                    at a university. On the weekends we would go to the campus, go for coffee, go to
                                    bookstores, so it was a very familiar place for me to be—a university. I’m also
                                    married, I got married between my two graduate degrees, and so I’ve been able to do
                                    graduate school thanks to a very supportive husband who’s been really—I’ve been
                                    really fortunate in terms of, he’s allowed my career to be a priority in our
                                    relationship. And I guess on a professional level, I’m a researcher in Astronomy,
                                    specifically in Astronomy Instrumentation.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Alright, thank you so much. Now
                                    can you tell us a bit about your education and your STEM experience? Just elaborate
                                    on that a bit further.</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Yeah, of course. So
                                    I grew up going to public school, and I went to do my undergrad in Physics and
                                    Astronomy at the University of Victoria in Canada. And I did a four-year
                                    undergraduate degree. During this period I wasn’t part of the co-op program, but I
                                    did do co-ops, so I did three co-op terms. I think to get an official designated
                                    co-op degree it required four. And during these co-ops I worked at the National
                                    Research Council of Canada, which is also in Victoria, and it’s an observatory where
                                    they do science but they also build instruments for astronomy. And then I went on to
                                    do a master’s degree, and I actually did it in applied science in Mechanical
                                    Engineering at the University of Victoria. Finally I went to pursue a Ph.D and I did
                                    that in Astrophysics at Leiden University in the Netherlands.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>How would you say that co-op
                                    experience affected your STEM journey?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Oh, it definitely
                                    had a major impact for me. So I knew I was always interested in STEM, I was always
                                    interested in tech and science, biology, chemistry, physics—I loved math. And, you
                                    know, physics and math were a bit more difficult for me, and I actually really liked
                                    the challenge of that, and that’s kind of how I went into a physics degree and math
                                    degree because it was something I really enjoyed but it wasn’t until I did a co-op
                                    that I could see a career in STEM. So my first co-op was—you know, you would just
                                    apply to these different jobs that were available, you’d see like, this one sounds
                                    interesting, and I ended up being a telescope tour guide and working with the public
                                    at the observatory—also working on science programs for kids, and summer camps, and
                                    doing public observing: so on a Friday and Saturday night people would come and you
                                    would observe with them through a 1-Meter class telescope. And that environment also
                                    exposed me to the other people that worked there that were actual researchers in
                                    science, in astronomy, but also the engineers that were working there. I was able to
                                    do two more co-op terms there: the first one I did a pure science one, so I was kind
                                    of analyzing astronomy data, and then over lunch and coffee with the different
                                    people there, I realized there was an engineering side to this. Something where you
                                    could build and design instruments and push technology to come up with new ways of
                                    measuring things that would allow astronomers to have new tools and they could make
                                    new discoveries through those tools. I was like, “oh, this is awesome,” like “I
                                    really like the idea that you can be in science and be in this space of research but
                                    also be doing something hands-on.” And so that is why for my third co-op term I was
                                    able to connect with somebody who was working in the optics lab there, so I worked
                                    with fiber optics and figured out how to polish them and get them working for
                                    specific instruments they were building. Through my co-op terms I went from being
                                    like, “This is something I really enjoy, this is something cool” to really seeing
                                    all the different career aspects that you could have and you could see it as
                                    somewhere I could pursue an actual career.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Alright, great. I’ll just quickly
                                    go back to the education piece: I just want to know about the difference you’ve
                                    noticed with European universities and why you specifically chose to study in the
                                    Netherlands.</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Yeah! So I was
                                    looking specifically for a place that really fostered astronomy instrumentation.
                                    It’s kind of this niche area where you need to have that engineering background, so
                                    you need exposure to mechanical, electrical engineering, some software, and you also
                                    need to be understanding the current research that’s being done in astronomy and
                                    astrophysics, so you kind of need to be on both sides of the engineering and pure
                                    science. There aren’t that many departments that offer grad programs that allow for
                                    you to have the experience and the exposure to both of these things, and cultivate
                                    that in you. I always knew that Leiden University had a specific group that did
                                    this, and so I kind of wanted to be there and to be part of that. I guess also I am
                                    Dutch as well, so I’m Dutch-Canadian, and so it made it much more—it made it less
                                    scary, the concept of moving to Europe and to another country to pursue a degree.
                                    It’s very different there. So the first thing is as a grad student or as a PhD
                                    student you have to come in with a master’s degree. You can’t come into their grad
                                    program without a master’s. Versus like in Canada, you can go into a graduate
                                    program and you start off in your master’s and it’s very common to do a transfer—so
                                    you continue with the same group that you’re working with, and it transfers and
                                    becomes your PhD program. But there they want [those] two distinct degrees. You’re
                                    also a government employee there, so all PhDs in STEM are paid the same no matter
                                    what university you go to—you get benefits, so it’s very transparent from that point
                                    of view. Then the other side of it is, I guess, specifically Dutch society is less
                                    hierarchical. So very much you’re viewed as a collaborator. At the beginning you’re
                                    maybe someone who’s more in training, and your supervisor is definitely more guiding
                                    you, but then eventually they really take it to be that by your second and third
                                    year you’re driving your research and you’re more a collaborator or a co-creator
                                    with your supervisor towards the end project or research that you have. So it really
                                    allows for you to take on responsibility sooner and it helped me grow in that
                                    aspect. I think from just having friends in the Canadian system, it was more
                                    hierarchical, where they were always kind of below their principal investigator,
                                    their supervisor, but that really depends personally on the individual, the group,
                                    and the university.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Thank you so much for telling us
                                    that, Maaike. One thing that we also wanted to expand upon was encouraging youth to
                                    participate in STEM, and how would you go about encouraging you to get involved in
                                    STEM, or any opportunities in particular like co-op that youth could do?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>So I guess, youth do
                                    you mean undergrads or high schoolers?</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>High schoolers like us, yeah.</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Okay, high
                                    schoolers. This is a very challenging question, but I think like—taking from the
                                    point of view of astronomy, if this is something that interests you, there’s the
                                    Royal Astronomical Society—so there’s usually different societies or different clubs
                                    that will participate in different aspects of STEM. So the Royal Astronomical
                                    Society, they come every single Friday and Saturday night—or they used to, they set
                                    up their own telescopes and do public observing. And as a co-op student, I was
                                    interacting with them, and I found I learned so much from just speaking to them.
                                    They had so much knowledge and—yeah, it was just so wonderful being part of that
                                    community and getting to experience it. I highly recommend if there’s a club or
                                    society, that’s a really good way in because the people there will be able to foster
                                    your interest. I also—you know, I helped with some summer schools and they’re more
                                    geared towards undergrads as well, but I think there are ones out there that are for
                                    high schoolers, but if you can get experience—especially in STEM, in physics or
                                    astronomy or engineering—having programming experience, I think that’s something
                                    where there’s a lot of online courses that will let you learn Python and stuff. So
                                    doing those types of things helps you to have—changes your way of thinking and
                                    teaches you how to problem-solve in a way that’s super useful for pursuing STEM, but
                                    it also is something that is, you know, if anyone has a computer they can learn
                                    these things, so it’s very accessible. I guess another thing is there are now
                                    programs out there that do citizen science, and I think this was an astronomy thing
                                    where we had so much data that we couldn’t all look at it, so we actually asked
                                    volunteers to look at it, so I think like Galaxy Zoo is something, and I think other
                                    fields like biology and chemistry have now taken on this model where you can be
                                    involved from anywhere in the world, no matter your age, you can be participating in
                                    it. Some of these things have even led to members of the public being on papers and
                                    stuff because they’ve discovered really cool things and they’ve connected with
                                    scientists in that way. I think with the Internet and social media, there’s lots of
                                    ways to connect and if anyone’s interested in connecting with astronomy, they can
                                    reach out to me, I guess, and I’ll help them.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Thank you so much. You mentioned
                                    that part about being really accessible and open to anyone around the world. So how
                                    do you think intersectionality plays into STEM?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Oh, I think
                                    it’s—okay, for myself I think we definitely need to continue to make room in STEM
                                    for everyone to bring their full identities into STEM. I think that’s super
                                    important, and I think it really allows for us to have more fun doing STEM, but also
                                    to come up with creative solutions as people come from different backgrounds and
                                    different points of view and they interpret data differently, they see solutions
                                    differently. So I think STEM is going to be a better environment when we have more
                                    people and we have more diversity and everyone feels comfortable and welcome in such
                                    situations. Does that answer your question fully?</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Yes, thank you so much. Also,
                                    just going back to your career now—what do you think is the most groundbreaking
                                    discovery you’ve made, either scientifically or about yourself, and why?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>I think the most
                                    groundbreaking is about myself. I’m too early in my career to have done necessarily
                                    impactful, groundbreaking things for my field. But I think one of the biggest things
                                    was kind of this idea of imposter syndrome or always thinking of the ideas I have,
                                    being young or relatively new in a field, that someone’s had this idea before or
                                    this question isn’t a good question, or these different things. You may feel really
                                    unsure or feel like you don’t belong. I think just taking part in different
                                    committees that I have to be on and different things that are part of my job, I’ve
                                    really had this opportunity to see my own questions and thoughts be validated. So
                                    for example, I take part in time allocation committees, so this is where, in
                                    astronomy you write a proposal, and a group of peers is going to say if it's worth
                                    time on a telescope or not. This was a very terrifying thing for me to start out
                                    doing. My first time doing it I was thinking, “how am I supposed to judge someone
                                    else’s science and their work?” And so being in a committee setting with many people
                                    from different experience levels and backgrounds, I was able to see internally, “I
                                    have these questions,” or “I have this initial reaction to this,” or whatnot. And
                                    see that being validated and basically seeing like, hey, actually everyone else in
                                    the room agreed with that or had that thought. And that allows for me to speak up
                                    more, and really say—hey, I belong here, my questions and opinions matter, and I
                                    don’t need to earn that, but I can just come up and say those things. I think on a
                                    personal level, tackling that imposter syndrome over the last few years.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Thank you so much for sharing
                                    that with us. Okay, so in the present moment, what kind of work are you doing in
                                    your field?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Yep. So I work in a
                                    very niche field called Adaptive Optics, and so Adaptive Optics is, I guess—when you
                                    look at a star, you see that a star twinkles. And this is actually due to turbulence
                                    in our atmosphere, so the air blowing around actually causes the twinkling of stars.
                                    An astronomer, when they want to take a picture of a star—and from that picture we
                                    can extract information—that twinkling basically is the same thing as you taking a
                                    photo and your hand shaking, and your picture is going to get blurry. So that’s
                                    what’s happening, is the turbulence is kind of shaking the star and we get a blurry
                                    image. Adaptive optics is us correcting for atmospheric turbulence in real-time.
                                    What we do is we measure what the turbulence is doing in the atmosphere, and we have
                                    a mirror that is really really thin and also really small, about the size of a
                                    quarter, and we shrink the light down onto that mirror and the mirror changes shape,
                                    so it can change shape and become like, a potato chip or whatever you want. We can
                                    actually cancel out the effects of turbulence using this mirror, and it has hundreds
                                    to thousands of things on the backs of the mirror that we can push and pull. We can
                                    do this up to thousands of times per second. I work on pushing this technology even
                                    further: improving it for the application of directly imaging planets outside our
                                    solar system. So we want to take pictures of planets that are next to really bright
                                    objects—we have to provide a really stable correction and completely remove the
                                    effects of turbulence. I work on improving the different aspects of the technology.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Alright, thank you. I was
                                    thinking—does the hesitancy of iconoclasm affect progress from happening. So, for
                                    example, Cecilia Payne introducing her groundbreaking thesis on how stars were
                                    composed and how they needed hydrogen and helium, and her thesis getting immediately
                                    rejected—do you think that affects the field of astronomy and how so?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>So I think there’s
                                    kind of two sides to that. So I guess in the theoretical side of astronomy, for
                                    sure, I think there’s some tension when you challenge something that is assumed.
                                    And, you know, you have also different personalities involved, and you have
                                    seniority and hierarchy and stuff, but on the—one thing I really like about my side
                                    is that in instrumentation, where we are kind of trying to push it, we need those
                                    new ideas. We thrive off of that. We need somebody to be like “hey, let’s try this
                                    crazy thing,” and so we all get very excited about that. I’d like to think as a
                                    community, the astronomy instrumentation specifically—the adaptive optics
                                    community—is very open to these rocking-the-boat kind of ideas and we really like
                                    that. We recognize that’s how we’re going to push technology and push the direction,
                                    and get instruments that allow the scientists to do crazier, better science. I think
                                    in instrumentation it’s slightly less of a problem.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Okay, thank you so much. Just
                                    talking about—I don’t know—what is the biggest challenge that you’ve experienced in
                                    your career or in your life so far?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>I don’t know. I’ll
                                    pick a recent one. It’s actually—it feels like it’s the biggest challenge right now.
                                    Sometimes the ones that are the most recent are fresh in your memory so you feel
                                    like they are the biggest. On Sunday and Monday, actually, I was commissioning—so
                                    that means installing and testing and getting the first time light passes through a
                                    new camera on a telescope about a two-hour drive from here, and you know, we thought
                                    we had thought about everything, we had talked to all the people and then on Sunday,
                                    we had it installed, and everything was working, and we went for dinner. We came
                                    back from dinner and things weren’t working the way we thought it was! And it was
                                    actually a network, so a communication—how we were talking to the computers and
                                    whatnot—and this actually resulted in Sunday night, we weren’t really able to
                                    observe, and it took about twenty-four hours to actually solve this and so you’re
                                    basically on the mountain, scrambling to try and fix this, you’re trying to call
                                    people who you think can help you, but you’re also alone in terms of—in the end, you
                                    have to figure out how to get it to work. Despite spending three hours on Zoom the
                                    next day with different IT experts and software engineers to help troubleshoot this,
                                    they weren’t able to help me, and it wasn’t until breaking again for lunch and
                                    spending a few more hours working on it that we had the undergrad I was working
                                    with—we were about to give up, and then we had a crazy idea, “what happens if we do
                                    this?” and that kind of solved it. In that moment, that twenty-four hours, feeling
                                    the pressure of ‘it has to happen Monday or we won’t get a chance to get this to
                                    work again,’ and then having the difficulty where you don’t really understand, I’m
                                    not an expert in networking, so you’re just trying to come up with solutions.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>So how did that collaboration
                                    help with your process, and just in general collaboration?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Collaboration is a
                                    huge part of my job. Everything I do is in collaboration: I get to collaborate with
                                    all types of engineers and scientists, so, you know, on a weekly basis, interacting
                                    with mechanical, electrical, software engineers a lot, and then also collaborating
                                    with grad students and undergrad students. This past summer I was mentoring—the last
                                    two summers I’ve been mentoring an undergrad college transfer student, and it really
                                    teaches me how to break down tasks. Sometimes, you know, you get used to your own
                                    work but you have to be able to explain what you need done to other people, and you
                                    have to be able to break it down into smaller components and milestones. Especially
                                    working with an undergrad to make those manageable, and to help someone through time
                                    management, but also to make sure you’re being super clear in the goal and how to
                                    get there, and the motivation for why we’re doing this—that’s super important. I
                                    think it’s really fun to collaborate and work with other people, but it really keeps
                                    me—communication skills have to be good, you have to really value the people you’re
                                    collaborating with, their time is really important, so you don’t want to waste their
                                    time. You really want to treat your engineers, your professionals, really well, so I
                                    think communicating clearly and also communicating your appreciation to them is
                                    something that really allows for collaboration to thrive.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Based on that—giving positive
                                    feedback, and just giving them good experiences, was there a particular mentor that
                                    helped you during your studies or your career?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Yes. So actually I
                                    have a few, but specifically that very first co-op job that I took. My boss that
                                    hired me, essentially, it turned out his partner at the time—or wife, now—she was
                                    also a researcher in the exact same field as me. Kind of the two of them have been
                                    people that I can talk to and speak to and actually ask for advice on a career side
                                    and all these different things. They have been a couple that’s been supportive of me
                                    but also being people that I can speak to and voice concerns or ask for direction,
                                    and I can really trust what they’re saying to me. Always when you’re going through
                                    grad school you have advisors, so people that are directly guiding research and
                                    trying to teach you how to do research. Hopefully you have a good relationship with
                                    them, and I was very lucky that I did in my cases, and so those were definitely
                                    people that are mentors to me whether it’s teaching me how to write better, teaching
                                    me the scientific process—how do you tackle a question, how do you solve it for the
                                    first time, how do you ask good questions—all these different things that have been
                                    taught to me by mentors.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Okay—for those who are uncertain,
                                    they don’t even have a mentor in the first place, what would you say to them: they
                                    want to pursue STEM, but they’re not entirely sure what to do?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Yeah, so I think the
                                    very first thing is at least being—when you get to university it’s a lot easier,
                                    because you’re going to have profs that are teaching you in all these different
                                    things—don’t be scared to go up to people. I think you’ll hear when you have a
                                    teacher that you really like, don’t think you’re not worth reaching out to them. If
                                    you think you’re like, “oh, this person, I really like how they explain things” but
                                    maybe you also hear about their research or things you’re interested in, they might
                                    have office hours or opportunities where if you’re in someone’s class, you’ll be
                                    able to go meet with them. They’re kind of an open-door policy where you can come
                                    and ask questions. Often you assume that it’s with the course material. You can
                                    [also] go and ask about their research or anything, and also sending emails to
                                    people and saying like, “hey can I meet,” but give them sufficient information and
                                    background and motivate why you’re reaching out to them, but I think, like, every
                                    time someone’s reached out to me I don’t react negatively, it’s really nice, it’s an
                                    honour, and I either say that I unfortunately don’t have time but reach out to this
                                    person, or talk to this person—you know, communicate with them. I think that’s
                                    something. It can be scary to think about, but don’t worry about that. Find clubs at
                                    universities or maybe at your current high school and your own teachers at high
                                    school, like they went and did degrees somewhere, so they have a lot of knowledge
                                    and connections as well. Don’t feel pressured to have to figure it out. I definitely
                                    didn’t go into my undergrad knowing what was going to be on the other side of
                                    finishing my undergrad, and sometimes we put a lot of pressure, when you start in
                                    first year, that you’ve made your decision, and that’s the direction you’re going to
                                    go. But don’t be scared to take other classes or to go out of your comfort zone, or
                                    to change something: changing a degree, or even taking a break from something—that’s
                                    not failure, that’s just you understanding yourself well and actually realizing
                                    things sooner than later. I don’t know if that fully answers the question.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>No that’s okay, you answered it,
                                    thank you so much. Referring back to that night where you had to fix the telescope,
                                    and that intense situation—would you say astronomy is usually a high-pressure field
                                    and how do you cope with that amount of pressure?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Yes, so there are
                                    periods where it’s very high-pressure, but I think especially in academia, so being
                                    kind of in the—right now I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the University of
                                    California Santa Cruz, and after your PhD you can try and go into industry, maybe,
                                    or if you want to continue in research you might want to find a position at a
                                    government research facility, or a lab, or something, but oftentimes between getting
                                    your PhD and kind of making that next step there’s this temporary position which I’m
                                    in. That’s very much a high-pressure situation because they are temporary contracts,
                                    and you often want to produce results, and the way that we measure results, at least
                                    in science, is through peer-reviewed papers. Astronomy is definitely one of the
                                    fields—sub-fields are slightly different within astronomy, but there’s definitely [a
                                    culture of] “you should be publishing” and that creates your value within the field.
                                    In instrumentation it’s very hard to publish because you’re not necessarily doing.
                                    You’re building something, and that’s not always a paper that’s novel. It’s really
                                    hard to balance that, so from that point of view, where your value or your worth is
                                    sometimes measured in these peer-reviewed papers, that can be a very stressful
                                    thing. And then when you have deadlines, when you’re putting something on a
                                    telescope, that’s also a lot of stress because you will have a certain number of
                                    nights: you get this amount of time with the telescope and if you don’t finish it in
                                    that period of time, it’s over. But otherwise, on a day-to-day basis, my goals for
                                    what I want to do for the day and all these different things, it’s much slower and
                                    much less pressure because I’m creating my own schedule, I’m putting on my own
                                    pressure, so it’s very self-driven from that point of view. All the projects and how
                                    quickly I move through them—my boss might have some demands, but usually it’s very
                                    collaborative to figure out deadlines and stuff. A lot of the deadlines are
                                    self-imposed. But of course you just want to have good performance, so the quicker
                                    you can do things, the more things you can do, and then the more papers you can
                                    write, so the better you can appear on paper, kind of. You just have to balance it:
                                    you have to see value in other things besides your life in STEM. I have to see value
                                    in my family, in the extracurricular activities I like to do, and I just have to say
                                    “no.” You have to just say “actually, I want to have a life outside of my job,” and
                                    saying 9-5 and then maybe on the Sunday and Monday, that was one of the extreme
                                    circumstances where I was trying to install something so I worked more hours and
                                    I’ll take more breaks this week, to balance it out and keep a work-life balance.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Alright, thank you. And what do
                                    you say inspires you or excites you about the field of astronomy?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Oh, I think just
                                    like—understanding what’s happening up there. I’ve always been in awe and wonder of
                                    nature and everything. From a young age, I—when I was in Grade 6 I was in French
                                    immersion, and our French immersion teacher, over Christmas, because we were doing
                                    science in French as well—this was the first year I was in French immersion. He said
                                    “when we come back from Christmas break, everyone is going to take turns teaching
                                    the class on a topic they chose.” So [we] got to prepare a lecture. And I think at
                                    that time there were kind of words in the news about nuclear [fission] and how
                                    that’s the future, and I discovered that the sun was doing nuclear [fusion], and I
                                    was like “this is the coolest thing ever!” So I went and did my project on the life
                                    cycle of stars, and I think just the amazement and wonder that I had over what was
                                    happening inside of stars, and how many stars there are up there—that really drives
                                    it. The beauty of it all really drives it for me.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Okay. And I think—I don’t know,
                                    Sophie, one more question? Or how many? </p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Sophie [V.O]:</strong>You can ask as many
                                    questions as you want. I did actually have my own question: I was wondering—I don’t
                                    know too much about astronomy, but I was wondering if light pollution and other
                                    issues from things like climate change and large amounts of population kind of
                                    affect your work, or sort of impede it in any way?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Yeah, those are
                                    really good questions. So light pollution is a huge deal in astronomy. For example,
                                    some of the smaller telescopes that maybe you’ve seen, depending on where you’ve
                                    travelled to—so I think the telescope I’m working on is just outside of San Jose,
                                    the Bay Area, or Silicon Valley. That one definitely has—you see light pollution and
                                    that limits how faint we can go, or how faint of a star we can look at. Some
                                    observatories have gone from something that is used for science to not being used
                                    for science because of light pollution. So we really like dark skies, it’s really
                                    important for astronomy, and then climate change: that’s something we’re trying to
                                    understand a bit more. One of my interests is not only “how do we correct for
                                    turbulence” but “how do we describe turbulence for astronomy?” and “how do we know
                                    what’s happening in our atmosphere?” I’ve kind of been trying to look at, “can we
                                    see a trend in the amount of turbulence in our air?” There was a Nature paper, a few
                                    years ago, that was looking at planes travelling from North America to Europe, and
                                    they found that you would experience more turbulence—the plane bouncing around. You
                                    would also potentially see that it would require more fuel to do that trans-Atlantic
                                    flight. They’re starting to notice that trend and that’s due to climate change and
                                    turbulence. That was like “oh, what’s happening in astronomy then?” because we care
                                    about turbulence too. It’s a slightly different kind of turbulence. We’re trying to
                                    understand that, but we need more data to do that, and so we think it’s a big deal,
                                    but we don’t fully understand it yet in astronomy.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Sophie [V.O]:</strong>Okay, I think that’s it
                                    for our questions—Anders, do you have any more questions?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Sure, I was just going to jump in
                                    with this question: what do you want your legacy to be?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Oh, my legacy! I
                                    guess for me, it’s very interpersonal. I just really hope that the people I work
                                    with and the students that I get to work with, that they have a really fun time,
                                    that they learn a lot but they also learn about themselves. And that at some point,
                                    they gain maybe one useful skill from interacting with me! Then, you know, on a more
                                    professional level, it would be really cool to have an instrument that enables new
                                    science. So to really build something that astronomers can do something new with,
                                    and yeah, I think in the next few years, I hope that will be a reality.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Okay. I think that concludes the
                                    interview. I just want to thank you for coming to this today, and thank you so much
                                    for coming on Unlocking STEM!</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Maaike van Kooten:</strong>Thank you both for
                                    having me! It was nice to meet you both.</p>

                We would like to acknowledge that Millennium STEM BC is situated on the unceded territories of the Coast
                Salish peoples—Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), Stó:lō and Səl̓ílwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh), and xʷməθkʷəy̓əm
                (Musqueam)
                Nations, and we honour the many territorial keepers of the lands on which we work, seek to recognize and
                address the systemic barriers that have historically restricted Indigenous peoples from pursuing success
                in
                STEM fields, thereby excluding critically valuable diverse perspectives. Funding scientific research,
                and
                preserving their cultures, languages, and traditions. Our work in diversifying STEM spaces is not
                complete.
                Decolonization is an ongoing process—we aim to elevate Indigenous voices in all of our initiatives, and
                to
                continually grow our understanding of how we can contribute to the reconciliation process.
