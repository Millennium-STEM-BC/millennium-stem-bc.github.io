                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">Host: Kiara Ting</p>
                            <div class="space-y-4">
                                <p class="text-md font-semibold text-gray-900">(Intro Music)</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Hey Chloe, thank you so much for
                                    coming. I’d just like to ask you a few questions about your journey to STEM. To
                                    start off, could you please tell me a little bit about yourself?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>I’m a first-year
                                    studying architectural engineering in University of Waterloo, and I have a
                                    particular interest in sustainable design and construction. That’s kind of what I’m
                                    looking to do for my career. But, aside from that, I really enjoy playing soccer and
                                    field hockey, and yeah, normal things like that.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Why did you pick to attend
                                    Waterloo? And how is it different from other universities you were considering?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>The main reason I
                                    chose Waterloo was because of the co-op program. I think that’s a pretty common
                                    answer for a lot of students. You get to do 6 terms in school and 6 terms on co-op.
                                    So you get to experience bunch of different jobs and explore different career
                                    opportunities, which is really nice for STEM. There’s so many different avenues you
                                    can go into, so you can explore all the different ones before you really decide for
                                    your career.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>So what courses are you taking
                                    now?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>Lots of different
                                    ones. The usual, math and sciences, calculus, linear algebra, and because my program
                                    also has an architecture part to it, I also take some art classes, design classes,
                                    few one like building structures and that sort of thing.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>So what kind of courses did you
                                    take in highschool to prepare yourself?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>I took as many AP
                                    classes I could, so like those Advanced Placement ones. I took physics, chemistry,
                                    calculus, pre-calculus. I also took some English classes and research English
                                    classes as well. So the AP seminar and AP research, which were really cool. Yeah, I
                                    overloaded my schedule a little bit.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Do you think that really prepared
                                    you for university?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>Definitely for my
                                    first term. Lot of my classes felt like review.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>So if you could go back and give
                                    yourself, give your highschool self some advice, what would it be and why?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>I’d say put a little
                                    less pressure on yourself? It’s like hard and highschool is supposed to be a bit
                                    more fun and enjoyable. Obviously, still challenge yourself and push yourself to get
                                    good grades and do well on school. But you don’t need to put so much pressure on
                                    yourself right from the beginning. It’s not quite as hard as people make it out to
                                    be to get into university. I mean depending where you want to go, ofcourse, but yeah
                                    I think just putting a little bit less pressure on yourself is good.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>And how did the application
                                    process for Waterloo go?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>It was fine. There
                                    was just like your usual form to fill out. You answer key questions about yourself.
                                    It’s pretty typical for most universities. So answer key questions about yourself
                                    about why you want to attend the university. Submit your grades, also get your high
                                    school or like the province to submit your grades. And then Waterloo had an
                                    interview as well for engineering. It was optional, but it was no problem
                                    [inaudible] few questions about yourself. So you want to make sure that you’re going
                                    to succeed there.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>That’s really cool. Why did you
                                    choose engineering?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>I chose engineering
                                    because of my mom. She’s actually a civil engineer and so growing up, I got to see
                                    all the projects she works on. And I also got to see few of the struggle she faced
                                    being a female in STEM. So I really wanted to go into STEM, and be one of those
                                    leaders and kind of show girls that they can do it too, because I think seeing my
                                    mom in that position, really influenced me to continue and pursue STEM.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>And would you say that there are
                                    a lot of girls who are pursuing engineering?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>Not enough. There’s…
                                    It’s definitely getting there. There’s more and more. Waterloo’s done a really good
                                    job. Their gender ratios are almost 50/50. In my program, there’s actually more
                                    girls than guys, and it’s about 60/40. So that’s another thing with Waterloo, like
                                    they have good gender ratios, but it’s still a work in progress. There’s definitely
                                    not enough females in the industry.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Do you feel challenged with your
                                    school work?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>Yeah. Some classes,
                                    yeah. They don’t teach you everything in highschool so you have to keep learning
                                    more. And also the way that they teach you at university is very different. There’s
                                    a lot more students in each class so it’s much less personal experience and you
                                    really have to reach out to the teachers if you want help. So it’s easy to fall
                                    behind or easy to kind of take a step back and let your grades fall. So, yeah it’s
                                    difficult and it takes a bit of adapting. But it’s definitely possible and it’s fine
                                    if you put a bit of work into it.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>You mentioned you play soccer and
                                    field hockey. If your school work is really difficult, how do you balance your time?
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>That’s a good
                                    question. I had to cut back on some sports. I was still able to join intramural
                                    soccer so I play once a week, but definitely not the same level as I played before.
                                    I used to play like 4-5 times a week. So, yeah I had to cut back a little bit but I
                                    think we always forget how much time there really is in the day. There’s more time
                                    than you think as long as you just plan for it. So, having a commitment like that
                                    was really nice. I was forced to go to soccer and I made time to go to soccer and
                                    then I got a bit of exercise and [inaudible].</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Would you say your sleep schedule
                                    has been maintaining or?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>Umm… No. I have been
                                    sleeping less. I still get a decent amount of sleep just because I didn’t have
                                    really early classes, but I’m sure once in person school starts up again, I will get
                                    much less sleep. But going to bed later is definitely a thing. Staying up doing work
                                    or... I mean in the night, it’s kind of when you have time to see your friends and
                                    relax, you work all day, so also just hanging out with people [inaudible] late into
                                    the night. But, it’s important to try and keep your sleep schedule, I think. It’s
                                    just hard. It’s normal.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>So why is STEM important to you?
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>I think STEM is very
                                    important because it is kind of at the foundation of everything. Arts are very
                                    important too, that’s why STEAM is emerging. But if you look at things around you,
                                    like a pen uses some sort of technology, like a mechanism to make it work; your
                                    laptop needs engineering and technology and different people in computer science to
                                    make it work so, like everything we do requires some form of STEM, so I think it is
                                    very important to understand it and very useful as well.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>What’s the co-op like?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>Yeah, so co-op, how
                                    it works is you apply to jobs through the Waterloo system. Different universities
                                    have their own systems and you can also look for your own jobs outside of it. But,
                                    basically you look for a job on the term before you start working, and then you get
                                    some form of job related to your field, and work there for 4 months. Sometimes 8 but
                                    generally 4 months. And yeah, you gain some experience and decide if you like it. If
                                    you do, you can try and work there again the next term and if you don’t, then you
                                    keep searching for something else. It’s a good way to learn about yourself and kind
                                    of learn what your interests are. But, yeah I applied to about 150 jobs on “Waterloo
                                    Works”, and didn’t hear back, so it’s difficult to find a job but just don’t give
                                    up. I mean eventually you’ll find one.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>So what kind of jobs are you
                                    looking at?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>I applied to the
                                    mostly jobs with construction companies. A lot of project assistants, project
                                    coordinator, a few estimator jobs, that sort of thing. I applied to one that was
                                    like a STEM workshop leader, we were like workshop coordinator, similar to what
                                    Millennium does but it’s a larger organization.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>So what do you see yourself doing
                                    in like 20 years?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>I hope to get a
                                    Masters in business actually. So that I can work in, more like an entrepreneurial
                                    type of job in the construction industry, still. I really like sustainable
                                    buildings. Not sure if you heard of like lead or passive house, these are sort of
                                    like standards that certain construction companies [inaudible] builds follow. And so
                                    they are more sustainable, some of them are like Netzeros so like zero energy
                                    emissions. So yeah, I hope to work something in like in that area and maybe start my
                                    own company, we’ll see. Whatever happens, happens.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>How big of a jump do you think
                                    university is from high school? </p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>I think it depends on
                                    how you prepare yourself and what you study. For me it wasn’t too big a jump, but
                                    online school probably made a little bit different than it usually is. Yeah, I know
                                    some people had different experiences than I did but I didn’t find it too too bad
                                    because the classes I took were university level. But a few people, I know around me
                                    really really struggled with the change. There was a lot more work, and lot more
                                    challenging, and a lot less support. So you just have to take in more initiative
                                    than you do in high school.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I didn’t find there was that many like actual transition programs. The university
                                    sends a lot of emails and so there were a few things like orientations supposed to
                                    have a few programs to get you used to it. There’s also lots of upper year students
                                    that are very very helpful. So in my program, because we’re already specified, it’s
                                    a smaller group of us, so the upper year students actually reached out to our entire
                                    program and were there to help us and give us advice, which was very nice. So like
                                    maybe there might be some facebook groups, you can look there, that’s really good
                                    way. I think you just have to take the initiative yourself.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The university does a bit less than coming from elementary school to high school,
                                    there’s a lot more from the school. But at university, there’s a lot, especially
                                    with students, really look for students. They’re always really helpful and willing
                                    to give advice.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>So, did you always know you were
                                    gonna be an architectural engineer, or was that something that came to you later on.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>It came to me later
                                    on. I found the program, when I was in grade 10 and when I found the program, it’s
                                    kind of when I decided, because it was brand new at that time, towards the end of my
                                    high school [inaudible]. But originally, I wanted to be a vet when I was little, and
                                    then an architect, but I realized that I didn’t have enough skills in like arts, so
                                    I went over to architectural engineering.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Can you talk a bit about student
                                    life at Waterloo, and how it has lived up or not lived up to said expectations,
                                    prior to COVID.</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chloe Chevallier:</strong>Waterloo has a pretty
                                    bad reputation, in terms of student life, so my expectations were very low going
                                    into it. I picked the school mostly because of the program and was worried about
                                    student life, but I’ve heard a lot about people say it’s what you make of it so like
                                    you put yourself out there then you’ll have a good experience. And I think that’s
                                    very true. I was kind of worried but it’s definitely true, if you put yourself out
                                    there, there’s a good experience. Just like meet new people as much as you can,
                                    because that’s one of the reasons I went to res(residents), is to meet new people
                                    because with COVID it’s really difficult. And I made lots of new friends there so
                                    and I still talk to them all the time. So I think, yeah just like try and take on
                                    those opportunities, with COVID it’s harder but you make a choice to go to residents
                                    and that’s a choice I made.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Also depending on what your scene is, there’s study groups, you can go to parties,
                                    that sort of thing. Waterloo is very close to Laurier. Probably not a good idea
                                    during COVID to go to a party but in not COVID times that’s definitely an option. So
                                    it really depends on what your scene is. But I think Waterloo it’s easier to kind of
                                    fall back and just study, but if you find some people who agree with you and also
                                    want a good student life, then you can kind of help each other out and take breaks
                                    from studying and go play games, go like do random things, or whatever.
