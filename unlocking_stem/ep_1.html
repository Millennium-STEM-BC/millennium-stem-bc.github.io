                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Hi Winnie, how are you doing
                                    today? I wanted to ask a few
                                    questions about your journey in STEM!</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Winnie Lai-Fong:</strong>Yeah, most certainly.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Sounds good. To start off, can
                                    you tell me a little bit about
                                    yourself?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Winnie Lai-Fong:</strong>Okay sure, yes. I am a
                                    first generation Chinese
                                    Canadian with immigrant parents that moved here in the seventies. So I think in a
                                    way they have imparted to me work ethics that make up who I am today.
                                    Professionally, I'm an engineer by training and have moved to the business side with
                                    a focus on program management. But I have always will have that geeky or tech-y side
                                    to me because the technology side is always near and dear to my heart. On a personal
                                    level, I'm a wife and the mother of two teenagers, two teenagers to, I am very proud
                                    of.
                                    <br><br>
                                    What else, as a person, I'm someone who's always on the lookout for the next
                                    challenge to stretch myself, the next thing to learn, the next thing to tackle, to
                                    make things better. So you can say that I'm not entirely content with the status
                                    quo, but I having said that I'm very grateful for what I have in life. So I'm very
                                    active in giving back, giving back to my faith community, to my professional
                                    community, my children's extracurricular community, and also to give back by
                                    investing in young talents at work. So I love developing people and helping them to
                                    grow and achieve beyond what they thought they could.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>You sound very passionate about
                                    STEM. So what inspired you or
                                    who inspired you to pursue a career in STEM?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Winnie Lai-Fong:</strong>I'd have to say it
                                    goes all the way back to high
                                    school when I was in grade 11. So my grade 11 physics teacher, I really enjoyed
                                    physics and the pivotal point was when he recommended, he highly encouraged me to
                                    apply for the summer program at SFU, where they were looking for several summer
                                    students to work in the physics department for research projects. And with his
                                    encouragement, I applied and I was chosen. I was one of the five people chosen. I
                                    was the only girl. I was only 16 at that time. And after working with the other four
                                    guys that summer, I came to realize that I could do anything that they could do. And
                                    with a passion for STEM, you know they talked a lot about engineering and STEM and I
                                    thought, “hey, that's very interesting too”, and I can do that. So I would say that
                                    really kind of was a pivotal point of my STEM journey. It was that summer. So what
                                    started it was my physics teacher and working with other people, but what really is
                                    sustaining and has sustained my journey in STEM was really various female engineers
                                    and also professors along the way that they have become true role models for me.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Sounds like a very unique
                                    experience you had with like the only
                                    female part. So during your journey in STEM, did you have any challenges that you
                                    had to face?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Winnie Lai-Fong:</strong>I'd say no looking
                                    back, you know, because when I
                                    went to UBC in engineering, there were very few girls, there were only four girls
                                    out of a class of a hundred. So I think that disparity was a bit of a challenge by
                                    itself. But looking back, the biggest challenge was probably being in the first
                                    cohort of UBC four year engineering program. So prior to that year, UBC engineering
                                    was a five-year thing. It was a first year science and then four year engineering.
                                    But that particular year they decided to try for the first time to combine
                                    everything into four years, which meant that it was really combining first year
                                    science with first year engineering.
                                    <br><br>
                                    And it was really, I would say super hard, super challenging. I don't ever recall
                                    working that hard in my entire life. There were 70 of us that started the program
                                    and after first year, there were only slightly over 40 of us left. And in fact, the
                                    hard work wasn't just at first, it was like all four years. It was really hard work.
                                    So I would say really what taught me doing the four-year program was perseverance,
                                    discipline, and hard work. And those have become part of my values and work ethics
                                    as I move from a student to the working world.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>You got lots of values and very
                                    like life lessons from that
                                    experience. Through all those experiences, you got a very amazing job. So what do
                                    you love about your job? And you might want to introduce a little bit about your job
                                    as well.</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Winnie Lai-Fong:</strong>Okay sure. What I do
                                    at Telus is program management
                                    for a technician systems of engagement. So this is basically the applications and
                                    systems for technicians to get their work schedule to them and how they interact
                                    with customers and the rest of Telus. So what I love about it is that I get to
                                    leverage technology to improve the quality of everyday life, everyday life for the
                                    technicians and for the customers to make it easier for them to communicate with
                                    each other, to make transactions easier between the customers and the technicians,
                                    and also for technicians to stay informed.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I know that I'm making a difference because I get positive feedback from the users
                                    of the systems. So precisely it is the technicians who have given very positive
                                    feedback saying that it has made the everyday job easier. It has cut certain times
                                    for them so that they don't have to spend as long waiting for certain things,
                                    basically has made their everyday work life easier and more enjoyable. So I find
                                    that very satisfying. Another thing that I really like about my work is that I get
                                    to drive the system strategy, the application strategy for the technicians, and have
                                    I also have the project team and the resources to execute on the strategy and also
                                    be able to measure the improvements that these projects are giving.
                                    <br><br>
                                    So when you think about it, it is really an end to end ownership, and it's very
                                    satisfying to see how an idea moves from the concept stage all the way to reality
                                    and delivering bottom line benefits to the company, and also improvements to team
                                    engagement, the people who are using the systems.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>It seems like your job has both
                                    STEM side and business side. So
                                    what catalyzed your motivation to pursue a career with such fields?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Winnie Lai-Fong:</strong>Yeah, that's a good
                                    question. I'd have to look back
                                    and say that it was something that I realized and learned about myself when I was
                                    doing a masters program. So I was doing a master's in applied science after my
                                    bachelor's degree. And my focus at that time was integrated optics. So essentially
                                    that was building an optical circuit on this very special material. And so besides
                                    doing mathematical modeling and computer simulation of the optical waves, I also had
                                    to work in a lab to make the actual optical circuit. And, you know, if you think
                                    about it was, that was not geeky, true, geeky stem.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I don't know what was right, but as I was working in the lab, I realized that I was
                                    not very good at that type of work. I was not very good at delicate work. I kept
                                    breaking things. I don't recall how many pieces of that precious optical materials I
                                    had broken. I just made my professor cringe. I'd made myself cringe and because I
                                    kept breaking the optics material, I was very slow in my lab work. And not only
                                    that, I realized that I was also not very careful with chemicals because as part of
                                    that lab work, I had to use chemicals to clean, to process the materials itself.
                                    <br><br>
                                    And how did I realize that I was careless with it, even though I was working under
                                    the fume hood, I found perfectly round holes on top of my socks. So we're talking
                                    about holes, not in the toe part of my socks, but on top of my feet. And the only
                                    way that those holes could have gotten there was I had inadvertently dropped some
                                    tiny droplets of some corrosive material on top of my socks. So all of that really
                                    made me realize that, yeah, I was really not careful and to top it off. I also found
                                    that I didn't like working in isolation. As part of my research, I had to work in a
                                    cold laser light lab to do different measurements.
                                    <br><br>
                                    And I found that was not really what I enjoy doing. I, I really wanted to be working
                                    with people, to bounce ideas off people instead of working in isolation. So all in
                                    all I'd say through self-discovery, I found that I, I thought I enjoyed pure
                                    research, but actually I enjoyed it less than I had thought. And I found that I
                                    really like working in a team environment and that's what really steered me towards
                                    to more on the business side than pure stem. And now I say that you know, my career
                                    now has both the stem and business side. And as I look back in the various years of
                                    my career, I can say that it has gradually been shifting more from stem to business,
                                    such that today is predominantly business with a much smaller stem component.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>You took a very unique approach,
                                    now I am wondering, did you
                                    have any troubles like adjusting to the business career without prior business
                                    education?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Winnie Lai-Fong:</strong>A lot of it was on the
                                    job training and I'd have to
                                    say that had some very good mentors along the way. One of my managers was really,
                                    really good with project management and through her, I learned a lot about project
                                    management. What does it mean? And that also sparked my own interest to take courses
                                    online, to learn more about project management and program management.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Another one of my mentor was someone that was really good at thinking strategically
                                    looking at strategic planning and looking at how to measure benefits for a project
                                    and from him, I learned that yes is important to have a strategy for any project and
                                    is just as important to be able to think about measuring the benefits of the outcome
                                    at the onset of the project and not at the end, such it can built in measurements
                                    along the way so that you can measure the progress. And at the end, you can say
                                    definitively, whether you've actually met your goal or not, and how it is performing
                                    and how it has helped the company. So I think those things has really kind of helped
                                    me along the way.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>It seems like you have a very
                                    long, interesting journey, high
                                    school, university, to even a career. In your opinion, what is the most interesting
                                    development and development in your field and why should people care about it?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Winnie Lai-Fong:</strong>Okay. Then I think I
                                    have to take a bit of a
                                    divergence from the technician side. Cause when I think of my field, it is really
                                    the telecommunications field, right? So the broad telecom, and I'd say the most
                                    exciting development in telecom is five G, which is the next generation of mobile
                                    technology. So we're currently on 4g. So our phones, mobile technologies on 4g. And
                                    why should people care about five G is because 5g will give us three things. It will
                                    give us higher speed, internet of things, and also lower latency.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I'm not going to go into details of how these things are going to help, but in
                                    combination, they really going to give us better productivity in terms of how work
                                    is being done, which it will be good for the Canadian economy. And as consumers, 5g
                                    will also give us better home automation, give us smarter homes, which if you think
                                    about it now there's a lot of home automation happening already today and there'll
                                    be even more with 5g and eventually going to smart cities. So smart cities would
                                    include things like autonomous cars cars that can communicate with each other.
                                    <br><br>
                                    And, and you may ask yourself, you know, why is it important for cars to communicate
                                    with each other? So an example would be, you know, if, if cars can communicate with
                                    each, each other, then even you, even if you're kind of driving it, you know, it's a
                                    bit autonomous and then there's an accident. If a car is the first car at the
                                    accident, sites can tell the other cars that, Hey, there's an accident here, take a
                                    different route. Then think about how much more efficient and better it is for
                                    people to avoid that traffic jam, that avoid accident sites. So that's just one
                                    example of what 5g is going to give us.

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>That sounds very innovative. So
                                    throughout your journey. What
                                    were some of your life lessons?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Winnie Lai-Fong:</strong>Okay, so I'd say I'm
                                    going back to my university
                                    years you know, just having that perseverance and discipline what I learned in my
                                    engineering, my four year engineering program, that goes a long way. You know, these
                                    are habits that have served me really well and have helped have helped me to
                                    overcome challenges. So I'd say that the earlier someone develops those discipline
                                    early on in life and integrating the habits the better. And I guess the second thing
                                    is just be honest with yourself about what you like and what you don't like.
                                    <br><br>
                                    You know, some people maybe by the age of 12, you know, they know exactly what field
                                    they want to go into, but I'd say most people don't, or they change their mind
                                    multiple times and that's perfectly okay. So when I look back, you know, I thought I
                                    would like research, but I ended up liking business more. And ultimately what you
                                    want to do is to find something that you enjoy doing, that you're good at, and that
                                    you get paid for it, right? That's always tell people, you know, what you want, the
                                    intersection of those three things such that you know it's like a Venn diagram and
                                    you get three circles. And the intersection point is that sweet spot. I guess two
                                    other things I want to touch on is that, you know, being a lifelong learner and
                                    staying curious and keep learning, these are lessons that I've learned is very, very
                                    important. And I'm not talking about just in a formal learning and taking courses.
                                    <br><br>
                                    That's good too, but I'm talking about learning from other people, learning from
                                    people who are more experienced than myself, even people who are less experienced
                                    than myself, because when you think about it, almost everyone that we interact with,
                                    we can always learn something from them. And having this mindset has really helped
                                    me be more curious, be kinder and also more humble when I interact with people. And
                                    I say, finally, the last one last lesson that I've learned is that there's always a
                                    story behind the face. So often I think, you know, all of us, it's easy for us to be
                                    too quick to judge or label anyone label someone. And I know that I've done that
                                    many times in my life and only to find that I was wrong in my assumptions. So with
                                    age, I've learned to be slower to judge and allow room for the story to come out
                                    when I interact with people.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Yeah. That could be a lesson for
                                    all of us. I do that as well
                                    so what was your favorite moment or part in your entire journey?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Winnie Lai-Fong:</strong>I'd say that's hard to
                                    say because there's been so
                                    many pivotal points and I really enjoy what I'm doing now. So I'd say just the
                                    learning process of self-discovery of finding out new things that I enjoy doing and
                                    integrating that into who I am integrating that into my practice and, and you know,
                                    that lifelong learning that being able to integrate strategy and technology and
                                    business and being able to measure the outcome and being good with numbers in terms
                                    of dollars, you know, doing the business case, managing capital, all of these
                                    things, I'd say these are really good skills that I've accumulated along the way.
                                    And, and I'd love to say that I planned it all out, but I didn't, you know, a lot of
                                    it was just kind of it happened along the way and I recognized that those were good
                                    things. I integrated them. So I would say that I'm very lucky, that way that along
                                    my journey, I learned many different things which have really added to my toolkit.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Hmm. What are some of your
                                    advices to like high school
                                    students?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Winnie Lai-Fong:</strong>Uh I would say high
                                    school students, I would say
                                    conquer what you're most afraid of. So as an example when I was in high school, I
                                    was super, super fearful of public speaking. And that even lasted no until I was
                                    like in my early twenties. And, you know, when I say super fearful, what I mean is
                                    that I would get so nervous that I would feel like throwing up, you know, oh, you
                                    know, get all sweaty or just really be super nervous. And and that didn't serve me
                                    well. And that was the fear that it took me until I was, I think it was when I was
                                    23, that I finally joined something called Toastmasters to practice public speaking.
                                    <br><br>
                                    So I would say that that was my case. I would say that to anyone, you know, in their
                                    teens that find out what you're most afraid of and look at it, head on in the eye,
                                    face it, conquer it, because really when you can conquer that first fear that will
                                    help you to become more courageous in looking at all your other fears and not let
                                    fear paralyze you because so often when we're afraid of something, we avoid it, we
                                    find different ways to bypass it, but that fear will always come back and will
                                    hinder us in our personal growth.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>I you talked a lot about giving
                                    back in the beginning. I know
                                    that you're doing something externally, which is like related to giving back. So can
                                    you tell me a little bit about that?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Winnie Lai-Fong:</strong>Okay, sure. I'd love
                                    to talk about bringing women
                                    together, which is intercompany organization to advance both diversity,
                                    inclusiveness and women in leadership. And it has six companies as a consortium. So
                                    it has to telus SAP, KPMG, Ascenture, Ledcor and Vancity, and together as a group of
                                    women and we're all volunteer and we don't get paid for this at all. You know, we
                                    put together events and forums to advance the discussion on women leadership and
                                    also how to advance diversity and inclusiveness and practices that each company can
                                    share with each other and also learn from each other. So that's something that I'm
                                    very excited and passionate about.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>What catalyzed you to be part of
                                    such an organization.</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Winnie Lai-Fong:</strong>Part of it is my
                                    desire to help with that advancing
                                    women in leadership women in technology, just that looking at how we can help the,
                                    the broader people to bring in diverse ideas, because when you think about it
                                    overall, when we try to solve different solutions for the world, especially in the
                                    stem side a lot of times, if you look at solving solutions with people that are,
                                    that only represent a certain segment of the society which potentially right now,
                                    it's, you know, when you think about it, a lot of the decisions are being made by
                                    male, right? So predominantly, you know, that particular segment of the society when
                                    they make solutions. So when they look at solutions, it may not be comprehensive
                                    enough such that those solutions may benefit certain groups at the expense of
                                    others, but when you bring in DNI and how that intersects with stem and overall how
                                    we solve the world's problems, then it is a more comprehensive solution such that
                                    you will not have groups that become disadvantaged.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>So would you take any other
                                    opportunities as like cater towards
                                    inspiring others?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Winnie Lai-Fong:</strong>Yes certainly, I think
                                    of what I've done at at the
                                    workplace, I have been instrumental in starting a lot of leadership programs and
                                    that is my way of giving back to investing and develop and developing young talent.
                                    So I was the, one of the founders of the engineering in training program at Telus,
                                    or I would say instrumental in revamping it many years ago because I was part of
                                    that program and having gone through that I wanted to make it better. At the same
                                    time I've had, I've had started two or three other leadership development programs
                                    at telus for either new hires or people trying to move from one particular job
                                    profile to a different types of jobs. So I really see that I'm investing in,
                                    developing in others is something that I'm very passionate about. And so that
                                    doesn't only apply to the, the adult or the working world, but even for, for
                                    students.
                                    <br><br>
                                    When I think about the importance of stem and overall investing in students and
                                    young people in, in stem I see stem as a way to help break this cycle of poverty for
                                    disadvantaged children. Because when you think about it disadvantaged families, the,
                                    for the children to, to learn, they may not even have the tools and to be able to
                                    help with and telus very good at providing a lot of these, you know, internet for
                                    good, in terms of helping some of these disadvantaged families. And when you think
                                    about how stem usually leads to better paying jobs that will help to break the cycle
                                    of poverty for young children.
