                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Just talk a little bit about your
                                    education and sort of your origins in STEM.</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Sure, yeah! I went to
                                    university—Simon Fraser University. I started in Computer Science, and I actually
                                    ended up finishing my degree in English with a minor in CS. The CS thing I was
                                    finding tough, and I was kind of wanting to be done with it all. Then I had the
                                    opportunity to do an internship at Neil Squire Society, working a summer job. And
                                    for me that was really transferable, because I could use those technical skills for
                                    social impact. So using those skills to help people. This was the early 2000s, I was
                                    helping people get their first email accounts on Yahoo and searching things up on
                                    AskJeeves and pieces like that, but really helping people make use of emerging
                                    technology to improve their quality of life.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>That’s awesome! And obviously you
                                    talked a little bit about Neil Squire, can you tell me a little bit about what that
                                    is and what the company’s purpose is?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Neil Squire is a registered
                                    charity. Its mission statement is ‘Use Technology, Knowledge, and Passion to Empower
                                    People with Disabilities.’ So [this is about] how technology and other supports can
                                    help people with disabilities do things that other people are doing. Like working,
                                    going back to school, just being in the community. There are a variety of programs,
                                    some around digital literacy—helping people have the skills to use technology—a lot
                                    of our programs are about helping people get back to work. Our superpower is
                                    assistive technology: so how you may use different tech or alternative technologies
                                    to communicate or get information into a computer or out of a computer. And then
                                    there’s also an R&D department, where we develop new technologies and develop new
                                    accessibility standards so there are more opportunities for equality for everybody.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>That’s really cool, actually! Is
                                    there a reason you became interested in this line of work specifically or was it
                                    more just the opportunity that came to you?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>It was definitely an opportunity.
                                    I would say for people who are starting their career and aren’t sure where they’re
                                    going to land, the nice thing about the majority of nonprofits is you really have
                                    the opportunity to try things and help things grow. When I took a permanent position
                                    [at Neil Squire] upon graduating from university, I was running the computer
                                    literacy program, and I started a computer refurbishing program. So this was the
                                    early 2000s, but we were getting donated computers and loading Windows on them, and
                                    we gave those computers to people with disabilities. That sort of opportunity to
                                    provide that foundational technology access was really transformative. You can
                                    directly see the impact you have on someone’s life, when you’re helping someone get
                                    a job or helping [them] get a computer or do things they weren’t able to do before.
                                    Many people come in and say “oh, I just want to get an email account or search
                                    things on the Internet,” and they realize that these terribly scary things aren’t
                                    actually that bad, and maybe if [they] can do this, [they] can do other things. It
                                    becomes a bit of a bridge to move onto going back to school or working or being
                                    connected to the community in other ways.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>For sure. Can you talk a little
                                    bit about how your job requirements have kind of changed with the advent of new
                                    technologies, or have they sort of stayed the same?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Mm-hmm.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>So just going back to your high
                                    school, how did you find the transition from high school to university and how did
                                    you adapt to some of those changes?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>No, definitely. The joke of the
                                    organization is that I’m sort of an ‘intrepreneur.’ I’ve had the opportunity to
                                    start new programs, get them up and running, build teams around them, and move onto
                                    the next thing. So a program we started around five, six years ago is Makers Making
                                    Change, and that’s really leveraging new fabrication technologies to make assistive
                                    tech: creating assistive devices that can be 3D-printed. Or doing a small run of
                                    circuit boards and making assistive devices that can be built for 100 dollars
                                    instead of purchased for 1000. [We’re] always learning, there are always new
                                    evolutions of technology, and that’s something you see all the time at Neil Squire.
                                    New technology comes to market, it changes the way we live and work, but if there’s
                                    not accessibility options for people with disabilities, it can create an opportunity
                                    where they’re actually further marginalized. So an example for that is your
                                    smartphone. We all have one, for better or for worse. Those came in 2007, and there
                                    wasn’t really any assistive tech that would help people use them if they didn’t use
                                    their hands to touch the screen until mid-2015, 2016. That’s something that changed
                                    the way the world worked, changed the way a lot of things happened, but for people
                                    with disabilities who didn’t have that ability to access the device, it became
                                    another way they were marginalized and couldn’t get information, and pieces like
                                    that. There’s always new technology, there’s always new gaps posed by that, and new
                                    opportunities to try and increase inclusion.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>That’s a really good point. I
                                    know I personally was learning a lot about classroom assistive technology,
                                    especially this summer, so do you guys deal at all in the educational aspect of
                                    that, or is it more an individual thing?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Yeah, actually the prime funding
                                    for Makers Making Change right now is through CanCode and supports their student
                                    learning program, which is really focused on reaching youth and doing STEM
                                    education. We have—let’s not 3D-print a Yoda head, or 3D-print a Groot doll, let’s
                                    3D-print a bottle opener, something simple like this, which is a simple key-turner.
                                    My boss is quadriplegic, he can lift his fingers through this and turn his car or
                                    open his keys, it’s maybe 50 cents worth of plastic, right? So there are always
                                    opportunities to leverage these new pieces of technology, and sometimes it seems
                                    like a really simple thing, but just to have those independence [aspects], we’ve
                                    helped people turn on their toothbrush, they couldn’t push the power button on their
                                    toothbrush. No one who’s twelve wants their mom brushing their teeth. So we’ve done
                                    a little hack on that so they can control it automatically. We do, in Eastern
                                    Canada, have a contract with the government there, where we’re really working with
                                    students in the classroom and helping them get the assistive tech to be successful,
                                    and it really carries on in post-secondary life too. Most of the clients we’ve
                                    traditionally served at Neil Squire are 18 or over, as they’re going into the
                                    workforce, but the Makers Making Change program is a bit of a different model. Many
                                    assistive tech programs are very top-down, so “you have a job, you need this
                                    technology in the job, you can apply for funding for it,” or “you’re in school,”
                                    etc. The Makers program is bottom-up. So someone can request from our website a dog
                                    treat dispenser, or a key turner—aids for daily living, not for a work or school
                                    context. That said, many things are used in the workforce. We have mouth-operated
                                    [computer] mice that we’ve developed, another assistive technology that’s used in a
                                    wide variety of settings, but that’s sort of the neat thing about this program, that
                                    it really cuts across different silos of where people are bucketed into—like you’re
                                    working, or you’re in this province, or you’re in school—anyone can request
                                    something they need.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>I mean, I’d imagine there are
                                    some difficulties presented especially with developing assistive technology and not
                                    necessarily knowing all the different challenges that people might face when posed
                                    with those. Do you think that’s one of the ways you’re able to get around that and
                                    focus on solutions on solutions that you’ve been able to come up with?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Yeah, and we’ve done a lot of
                                    work in also trying to educate and collaborate with different disability service
                                    providers, whether that’s rehab hospitals or children’s hospitals or recreational
                                    therapists or occupational therapists, to let them know that “this device doesn’t
                                    need to be a $500 thing that you buy from manufacturers in the States. There are
                                    students down the street who can help build this for you quickly and affordably.”
                                    There’s definitely that awareness-raising, bringing two different communities
                                    together. There’s the Maker community, that has these fabrication skills and pieces,
                                    this ability to make things, and then there’s the people that need stuff but may not
                                    be aware that some of these things can be fabricated. We’ve hit that tipping point
                                    of awareness, to a degree, but there’s always more people to grow our network and
                                    grow our community. We’ve delivered over 5000 assistive devices, we’ve served people
                                    in 33 countries, which is way beyond our wildest imaginations when we started, how
                                    much this would take off. I think a lot of people, especially millennials, really
                                    look at how they can give back with their skills, right? Like “how can I use what I
                                    am good at to give back to the world?” and this is an opportunity to do that, for
                                    people to use those STEM skills they’re developing and have a social impact.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Mm-hmm. What would you say
                                    happens in a regular day of work, and what does it look like?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Yeah, for sure.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Okay, why did you choose computer
                                    science out of all the sciences out there?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Sure! I mean, it would depend on
                                    who’s doing the job at work, but for me, it depends on the day. I do a lot of
                                    fund-raising and partnership development, but one of the events that we do run, and
                                    we run hundreds of these now, are these build-a-thon events. That’s where we have a
                                    number of people that come together for a day and help build some of the assistive
                                    devices, whether that’s hacking toys for kids with disabilities, or building
                                    adaptive video game controllers. On one of those days, we’ll set up the work
                                    stations—maybe soldering irons and some hand tools. When people arrive, we give them
                                    a bit of “what are you building and why are you building it?” like ‘how does it
                                    actually help people, why does it matter?’ Sometimes we’re able to have a guest
                                    speaker like an occupational therapist that works with kids with disabilities who
                                    might need it, people who have benefited from the devices. And then we’ll work with
                                    people, and we work through building these devices almost like a Lego project or
                                    IKEA, where they have the bits or the components and they might be screwing some
                                    things together, soldering pieces, connecting it, flashing the Arduino code, and
                                    then at the end, those devices that are made can go to community partners in the
                                    area. That’s what a standard build-a-thon day looks like. When we started this out,
                                    we thought that this was a great way to fabricate a whole bunch of things quickly.
                                    What became very apparent to us was that the people who volunteered really also had
                                    that tremendous sense of fulfillment, that they’re able to give back in a meaningful
                                    way. It’s been really a win-win across the board.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Yeah, and do you think you feel
                                    that same sense of satisfaction or fulfillment in your own work?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Oh, for sure, I’ve had the
                                    opportunity to go and speak about this all over Canada and the United States.
                                    Sometimes a few people’s pictures come up and I try to tell a story [about them],
                                    and I’m like, “keep it together, Chad,” you know what I mean? “You’re up here to
                                    tell a story, not to cry on TV,” so to speak. It’s very impactful to see how simple
                                    things can really make a major impact in the quality of people’s lives.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Definitely. And what would you
                                    say the biggest discovery you’ve made either in your field or about yourself while
                                    doing this work is?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>That’s a good question. One of
                                    the things that—especially when I started the work, and I tried to stay very
                                    open-minded, and take the approach that “I don’t know what I don’t know,” [I saw
                                    that] there’s a huge social-economic divide. When I was first doing our computer
                                    refurbishing program, and I was getting computers ready to go into people’s homes, I
                                    would have, usually every Wednesday, I would go do that. So to break up the
                                    work-week I’d go around, it feels great to give computers a home, but to go into
                                    people’s different living situations and see how they’re living or what they’re
                                    living without, to do that, really opened my eyes into the gaps and pieces. I had
                                    the opportunity, early in my career, to set up a disability learning center that’s
                                    still running with the Penticton Indian Band. I lived up on band land for two weeks,
                                    and that was very, very eye-opening. Learning the different cultural ways and how
                                    they approached things—again, I tried to not come off as the “white guy from
                                    Vancouver here to tell you how to run things,” and just be very open-minded and add
                                    value where I could, to always listen. That was tremendously rewarding. It really
                                    helped also build that relationship: the fact that I was willing to live there,
                                    attend their events and learn, and sand logs with the youth that were going into the
                                    building and fabricate, and do my best to walk a mile in their shoes for a couple
                                    days. Obviously, a couple weeks is not the same as living that life, but trying to,
                                    you know, be open-minded. It makes you really appreciate the things that you have
                                    the opportunities you’ve had, when you see some of the frustrations and barriers
                                    that people have faced and the opportunities they haven’t had, going through that.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>And since we’re talking about
                                    these intersecting socioeconomic barriers, can you talk about the way that these
                                    stop people from getting into STEM, or even just accessing careers or education, and
                                    how your company is working to solve those?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Great question. We’re really
                                    focused on our current funded project to reach underrepresented groups in STEM.
                                    There’s some great work and projects happening for different people—Black Boys Code
                                    is a great organization that’s trying to leverage Black communities and introduce
                                    them to STEM opportunities, there’s a lot of great women in engineering groups,
                                    women in science, we’ve had a lot of success with those sort of groups throughout
                                    the country. We’re really focused on that. So instead of saying we’re going to serve
                                    a thousand youth to volunteer in our program, we’ve put specific metrics around
                                    youth: Indigenous, female, and people with disabilities, etc. That seems to be,
                                    again, really niche. There’s a lot of great people doing great work and trying to
                                    help the equity-seeking groups get those opportunities. We’ve not seen that in
                                    disability as much, in terms of those STEM and higher-learning, higher-opportunity
                                    careers. I think there’s still a lot of work to be done. We’re trying to target
                                    that. We’ve done a lot of work this summer in attending different disability camps.
                                    Whether that’s Easter Seals camp, or Diabetes—D-Days, they call them, a diabetes
                                    camp for kids—we’re trying to go to where those communities are and bring our
                                    expertise in, as opposed to expecting those communities to find us. Fish where the
                                    fish are swimming, you know what I mean? As opposed to throwing your rod somewhere
                                    and hoping something swims by. We try to meet people where they’re at, and bring our
                                    services and knowledge to them, and augment what they have, [instead of] expecting
                                    everyone to come to you and do things on your terms.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>I think that’s a really fantastic
                                    point. I feel like a lot of the barriers that exist are a result of expecting people
                                    to meet you where you are, rather than pushing your comfort levels to what they’re
                                    able to do. And I know this must be a tricky question because you’ve talked about a
                                    ton of projects that you’re doing, but is there one specific project or fund that’s
                                    really exciting you right now?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Yes. I will give you three very
                                    quickly—I know you only asked for one. Let me just grab this piece here. This is our
                                    LipSync. This is what really started our project. This is a mouth-operated mouse.
                                    We’ve built thousands of these things, and we’re about to release a new version.
                                    This one is a bit difficult to build, and it’s a bit hard to manipulate with the
                                    mouth. The new one uses the Hall effect sensor, it really does a proper 360-degrees.
                                    You try to draw a circle with our current [mouse], you maybe get a stop sign. So I’m
                                    very excited about that. It’s something we’ll hopefully get released by the end of
                                    the year. And we have a couple of projects that we’re really ramping up around
                                    accessibility in video gaming. There’s some great organizations in the States:
                                    AbleGamers does some great work, in the United Kingdom, there’s SpecialEffect, they
                                    do great work. Those are organizations where if you have a disability and you’re
                                    trying to game, you can work with them, and they’ll help get you set up with your
                                    accommodations, do some game testing and figure out your opportunities to game.
                                    There’s nothing like that in Canada. We’re making a push at that. Some of our staff
                                    are speaking next Saturday at the Accessible Gaming conference in Toronto, and I
                                    think there’s a real need there. It’s not just like “oh, video games are just for
                                    fun.” Well, yes. But also they have more economic impact than Hollywood in terms of
                                    GDP, and I think we definitely saw during COVID, people gaming a lot to stay
                                    connected. It’s really got a social aspect. I’m very excited about that sort of work
                                    and the technologies we’re building around that to make gaming more accessible for
                                    people with disabilities.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>That’s awesome. You mentioned
                                    COVID—so I’m sort of wondering: the first question is how COVID has affected your
                                    work specifically, and the second—I know I’ve noticed people discussing COVID has
                                    changed the conversation around how we talk about chronic illness and disability, so
                                    have you seen those effects on your work?</p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Definitely. One of the major
                                    barriers for people with disabilities in finding employment is just getting to work.
                                    Transportation in Vancouver isn’t awful, compared to other parts of Canada that have
                                    real winters and snow, so people that maybe can’t drive, they’ve got to get out of
                                    their door in their wheelchair in the snow to a bus stop, wait for a bus that maybe
                                    comes every half-hour—there’s so many barriers to just showing up. So the ability,
                                    and I think really the proof of COVID that people can be productive employees
                                    without all sitting with the same roof over their head, opened new opportunities for
                                    remote work and for people to work on their own time with that flexibility. I think
                                    that’s opened a lot of doors and opportunities for people with disabilities. For us
                                    at Neil Squire, people with disabilities—the majority of them have some underlying
                                    chronic condition, so we’ve been very cautious with that. In our classrooms, there’s
                                    still usually one participant, maybe staff working with them, we’re not doing full
                                    classrooms again. But it’s been interesting. Before COVID, our last annual report
                                    showed that we served just over 4000 people that year. This last year, we served
                                    over 6,600 people. So there were barriers, there were frustrations in the early
                                    days, but the change in the way you work and the way you think creates new
                                    opportunities and helps you reach people that otherwise maybe you wouldn’t
                                    serve—especially people that are rural or remote. Providing online access to
                                    services really opens opportunities for people with disabilities, by being flexible
                                    and having those spaces to get them in and get them engaged.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>I think the flexibility is a
                                    really big part. Because, like you mentioned, people who are both disabled and live
                                    in rural areas kind of face a double barrier in accessing the kind of care that they
                                    need. </p>
                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>For sure.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>And then I was wondering with a
                                    more process-oriented question, what kind of feedback and optimizations do you do to
                                    each product before it goes into its final form? I imagine that there must be a lot
                                    of improvements made in terms of user experience, and sort of the way that people
                                    interact with the product itself?</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Oh, for sure. That’s the nice
                                    thing about this makers model, using local fabrication pieces. I’m not making a mold
                                    and sending it overseas, waiting six months for it to come back. I can print
                                    something for someone, they can try it the next day and go “the screws rub my hand
                                    here,” or “it’s a little tight there,” and you can adjust and fit it. For the
                                    majority of the products in our library at Makers Making Change, I think it’s also
                                    important to say that it’s an open-source library. Over half the things in that
                                    library are not made by me or my engineers. It’s crowd-sourced and has a wide
                                    variety of things, which is really boiling up the community’s best practices. We try
                                    to make sure that people are using it and that we have good feedback and
                                    experience—not just publishing for publishing’s sake. Our best projects are driven
                                    by community need, where there’s a gap, so people can use it and test it. Ideally we
                                    have occupational therapists or disability professionals looking at it and giving us
                                    the feedback. Some are simple things that don’t go through such rigor, but some are
                                    more in-depth projects like the LipSync. We’ll build stakeholder groups, they’ll
                                    give us feedback, and I’m a big believer in “fail fast, iterate quickly.” You’re not
                                    going to get it right the first time, so don’t try to build something for six months
                                    and show it to someone. Build something in six minutes and show it to someone. Find
                                    out all the terrible things about a six-minute build, then iterate. Fail fast and
                                    build on the lessons you learned as you go.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Do you think there’s a certain
                                    project or challenge that really taught you that lesson within your career?</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Yeah, the LipSync. We got that
                                    going through a funded project by Google, and it sort of had three major components.
                                    One—and you had to do one and two before you got the second half of the grant. One
                                    and two were “have the product and scale it out to 150 people.” Our first version of
                                    the LipSync, which we were very excited about, was built on a video game controller
                                    thumbstick, joystick. They’re well-supported and used all over the place. But by the
                                    time we built a bit of the CPAP interface so people could left-click, right-click by
                                    sipping on it, [the controller’s range] became quite a wide range of motion, and the
                                    amount of head movement someone needed to move to articulate the mouse was
                                    significant. When we’re dealing with people who are using this, [some of them] have
                                    high-level spinal cord injuries. People were trying to use this and it was causing
                                    them significant pain. So here we were thinking that we’ve got this product, we’re
                                    all done, then we did user testing with our first 5 people and we realized that this
                                    was not going to work. There’s certainly lost opportunities. And a lot of things
                                    aren’t quite that severe, but when you’re making something for someone, for example,
                                    this is my palm pen holder. For some people, they might find, “I need some foam in
                                    there, my skin’s brittle.” Or “I need to change the angle of the pen,” or “I need a
                                    thumb-rest piece for it.” I guess the neat thing with our product library, with it
                                    being open-source, is that everyone’s different, but especially people with
                                    disabilities. Their functional capability, their range of motion, the change in the
                                    angle of their joints, it’s all so unique. So the ability to twist it and shape it,
                                    get that final ten percent right for them, can make all the difference. I can’t
                                    remember who told me, but someone said “if you’ve met someone with cerebral palsy,
                                    you’ve met one person with cerebral palsy,” because it presents differently. The
                                    functional capability of each person is different, their goals are different, what
                                    they want to do is different, so you’re not going to have this magic thing that’s
                                    going to be perfect for everybody. You want that ability to tweak and make it work
                                    with people’s needs.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>And besides that product, do you
                                    think there’s another really big challenge that’s been posed in your career, and
                                    sort of how did you get past that, or is it an ongoing thing that you’ve faced with
                                    a lot of different projects?</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Yeah, I mean—I would say one of
                                    the bigger pieces, and this is a little bit less about the technology side of it,
                                    but it can be just the sustainability of funding to run these programs. They go
                                    through different grant cycles. Every two or three years you’re writing for a major
                                    grant. Sometimes, there’s an election or things get delayed or changed, so trying to
                                    just have a steady program that you can run and consistently deliver is difficult.
                                    We’ve bent and changed the programs a little, to follow funding opportunities while
                                    trying to stay core to the mission, but it can be that tug-pull. As a non-profit, if
                                    you keep chasing the dollars, you can end up doing something that [doesn’t follow]
                                    the values and the mission of the organization. Our current funding is really
                                    focused on teaching youth STEM, but we’ve been able to try and make sure we’re
                                    teaching youth with disabilities STEM, and make those projects with youth have
                                    disability outcomes. But it can be a challenge, trying to keep the lights on to do
                                    the good work sometimes. In terms of the technology piece and access for people,
                                    finding the funding sometimes for people can be difficult. So I can 3D-print a ton
                                    of stuff, but if someone needs a custom wheelchair, getting through the application
                                    process, or like a van with a wheelchair lift, and someone is not working, they need
                                    that van for work. They can’t qualify for funding until they have a job—it’s the
                                    chicken and the egg thing. “How am I supposed to get $20,000 to get this van
                                    accommodated so I can get to work if I don’t have a job?” You know what I mean?
                                    Sometimes those roadblocks appear in people’s lives.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>And then I know I already asked
                                    about some present projects that excite you, but is there a past one that you’re
                                    really satisfied with the outcome of, or is that the goal you have with every new
                                    project?</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Yeah, I’m trying to think. One of
                                    the ones I really enjoyed is adapting toys for kids with disabilities. If you
                                    think—you know, you can go to Walmart and buy a teddy bear, the left paw sings you
                                    the alphabet, and the right paw sings you some number songs. If you’re a kid with a
                                    disability—I’m talking like a very significant disability, maybe 5 [years old] or
                                    under, you’re not crawling, maybe your speech isn’t developing, you can get the same
                                    bear that has switch access. The idea is that you’d have a button that can be
                                    positioned where [the child] does have functional capacity. So they may not be able
                                    to reach out and squeeze the teddy bear’s paws, but they might be able to tilt their
                                    head into a button, a piece like that. Those toys that are switch-adapted: if you
                                    buy them, they’re around $250 and up, and they’re at least ten times the cost of a
                                    commercial one. It’s not a complicated thing to do and to adapt. The switch jack
                                    looks just like the jack that you’d see on your headphones or your computer, a 3.5mm
                                    jack. So we buy different toys and take them apart, “okay, we’re just going to cut
                                    this wire here and wire this jack in, and just do it.” To be able to give those to
                                    therapists or families with disabilities is great. If you have a child with a
                                    disability, it’s so much additional cost and different things in your life, and to
                                    buy them a toy they can use is another $250. It’s obscene. To adapt toys and to give
                                    them to families with disabilities is really tremendous and very powerful. Even
                                    therapists, they often have budgets. They’ll have 8 toys and go around [to visit
                                    children with disabilities], “we’re going to practice our cause and effect learning
                                    with this child,” and at the end they leave and the toys leave, and—I don’t know
                                    about you, but practice makes perfect. If you’re only practicing that once a week or
                                    once a month, you’re not going to develop those skills nearly as quickly. We’re
                                    pretty excited, we’re just about to launch a campaign called Hacking for the
                                    Holidays. We’re going to have people volunteer. Anyone can sign up, especially
                                    university groups or classrooms, we’ll bring the toys in and teach people how to
                                    adapt them. We’re trying to get a thousand toys adapted in time for Christmas to
                                    give them to families that really need them.</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>That sounds really fantastic! One
                                    other thing I was wondering: obviously you’ve been at Neil Squire for a long time.
                                    How have you seen the definition of disability change over that time, and how has
                                    the organization expanded its scope?</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>When I started, it was very
                                    “adults and physical disabilities.” That was the core mandate and where our
                                    specialties were, where our funding was targeted. In Eastern Canada, we did a lot of
                                    work around youth and different pieces. That wasn’t always expanding the age range
                                    that we served, but also helping people with learning disabilities or literacy
                                    issues, using things like screen readers, speech to text systems to help build
                                    communication and find the learning style that works best for them. My work with the
                                    Penticton Indian Band also really helped to raise my awareness. The disability rate
                                    in Indigenous communities is almost twice that of the population. It’s hard to
                                    measure; there are certainly data-collection issues in Indigenous communities given
                                    the history, but there’s a huge need there. It was not just—high rates of arthritis,
                                    sure, but also—the spirit is broken. That unwillingness to engage or to lean in
                                    [when it comes to disability] and we need simple digital literacy education, simple
                                    pieces. I used to do the computer teaching side of it, and I would drive out there
                                    for the first week of class. We did a lot of online learning—this was early 2000s,
                                    before COVID, we were doing online learning at Neil Squire for a good decade and a
                                    half before the rest of the world was forced into it. I would drive up there and we
                                    would take a computer apart. We would demystify it. Doing the hands on piece: “it’s
                                    just a machine, we’re not going to break it and if we do, it’s not the end of the
                                    world.” It really ignited that interest in people, instead of just being the guy
                                    speaking through the headset all the time. Doing hands-on things [helped].
                                    Disability can be a wide range of pieces. It’s a marginalized group that can really
                                    expand. It doesn’t matter your race, your gender, your sexual preference, your
                                    ethnicity—disability is something that can happen to any sort of population. In some
                                    ways, it’s the world’s largest minority group, or the most inclusive minority group.
                                    Everyone has a connection in their life or a couple degrees of separation from it.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Yeah, I really love that you
                                    mentioned that. I was talking to a disability specialist earlier this summer and she
                                    spoke about how the disability community is really the only [marginalized group]
                                    that you can enter at any time. Any incident in your life can cause that to happen.
                                    Others have different criteria because they depend on your background, but
                                    [disability] is something that everyone can relate to because everyone has a
                                    connection to it in their life, so I’m glad you mentioned it. Just to wrap this up,
                                    I know this must be a difficult question, but if you had to pick one thing that most
                                    inspires or excites you about your work, what do you think it would be?</p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Chad:</strong>Well, I guess I’ll pick two. I’ll
                                    cheat. In working with the youth or volunteers that are making [products]. When they
                                    solder and test their toy, and it works, that toy they’ve ripped apart, it’s just
                                    like that oh, thank god moment. You can feel the relief and the joy of feeling like,
                                    I did it. So that’s always inspiring, seeing the volunteer. Sometimes we’re working
                                    with a corporation, they’re doing a team-building day. Some of them are engineers
                                    and some of them are marketing people, they’ve never touched a soldering iron—you
                                    know, they’re not really comfortable turning the screws on the toys. So for them to
                                    get through that and do it is really rewarding. But it’s just the change in people’s
                                    lives. When you hear people that are getting a job and work after three or four
                                    years, how that really empowers them to do things, is amazing. One of my first roles
                                    at Neil Squire was in communications, helping write success stories about people,
                                    just talking about people and hearing their stories: things they’ve gone through and
                                    things they haven't had, but what they’re doing with their lives now. It’s hard not
                                    to be moved when you see the impact and the change in people’s lives. I had someone
                                    say “we’re maybe not nurses saving people’s lives, but we’re definitely changing
                                    people’s lives [at Neil Squire].” </p>

                                <p class="text-md text-gray-900"><strong>Host:</strong>Yeah, that was a great answer! I
                                    honestly wasn’t expecting that much insight, but I’m really glad that you shared
                                    that. I feel like a lot of the time people see STEM and social impact as kind of
                                    disparate things, rather than something that can be united. So I think that’s the
                                    reason a lot of people don’t try to go into CS because they don’t know the social
                                    effects it can have, whereas when you see the work that people are doing, especially
                                    in the public sphere, that really motivates you to continue to do that work. Thank
                                    you for sharing and helping us unlock STEM!</p>

                STEM fields, thereby excluding critically valuable diverse perspectives. Funding scientific research,
                and
